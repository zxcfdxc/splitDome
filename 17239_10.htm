<P class="p3 ft5">Recycling falters as costs surge</P>
<P class="p4 ft6">BY MICHAEL CORKERY</P>
<P class="p5 ft7">Recycling, for decades an almost reflex- ive effort by American households and businesses to reduce waste and help the environment, is collapsing in many parts of the United States.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">Philadelphia is now burning about half of its 1.5 million residents’ recycling material in an incinerator that converts waste to energy. In Memphis, the inter- national airport still has recycling bins around the terminals, but every col- lected can, bottle and newspaper is sent to a landfill. And last month, officials in the Florida city of Deltona faced the re- ality that despite their best efforts to re- cycle, their curbside program was not working and they suspended it.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">Those are just three of the hundreds of towns and cities across the country that have canceled recycling programs, limited the types of material they ac- cepted or agreed to huge price in- creases.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">“We are in a crisis moment in the re- cycling movement right now,” said Fiona Ma, the treasurer of California, where recycling costs have increased in some cities.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">Prompting this nationwide reckoning is China, which until January 2018 was a big buyer of recyclable material col- lected in the United States. That stopped when Chinese officials determined that too much trash was mixed in with recy- clable materials like cardboard and cer- tain plastics. After that, Thailand and In- dia started to accept more imported scrap, but even they are imposing new restrictions.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">The turmoil in the global scrap mar- kets began affecting American commu- nities last year, and the problems have only deepened.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">With fewer buyers, recycling compa- nies are recouping their lost profits by charging cities more, in some cases four times what they charged last year.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">Amid the soaring costs, cities and towns are making hard choices about whether to raise taxes, cut other munici- pal services or abandon an effort that took hold during the environmental movement of the 1970s.</P>
<P class="p6 ft8">“Recycling has been dysfunctional for a long time,” said Mitch Hedlund, execu- tive director of Recycle Across America, a nonprofit organization that pushes for more standardized labels on recycling bins to help people better sort material. “But not many people really noticed when China was our dumping ground.”</P>
<P class="p6 ft8">Perhaps counterintuitively, the big winners appear to be the nation’s largest recyclers, like Waste Management and Republic Services, which are also large trash collectors and landfill owners.</P>

<P class="p9 ft12">Apple ready to lay out its challenge to Netflix</P>
<P class="p10 ft13">Tech giant to present details on a dozen shows and is planning more</P>
<P class="p11 ft6">BY JOHN KOBLIN</P>
<P class="p12 ft2">Apple is coming to Hollywood. Delete that.</P>
<P class="p2 ft7">Hollywood is going to Apple.</P>
<P class="p13 ft8">Next Monday, a delegation of producers, studio executives and big- name actors will enter the subterranean <NOBR>1,000-seat</NOBR> Steve Jobs Theater in Cuper- tino, Calif., for one of those Apple show- cases, with the chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalists.</P>
<P class="p13 ft7">This time around, the focus won’t be on the next <NOBR>must-have</NOBR> device. With iPhone sales showing signs of fatigue, the event is intended to draw attention to the company’s <NOBR>billion-dollar-plus</NOBR> bet on entertainment, an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.</P>
<P class="p14 ft7">The premiere date for the service is getting closer, with the first of a dozen or more shows likely to start streaming be- fore the year is out. At next week’s pre- sentation, Apple is expected to reveal details of what it has been working on with stars from both sides of the camera, like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Anis- ton, Brie Larson, Jason Momoa, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shya- malan and Steven Spielberg.</P>
<P class="p15 ft2">The tag line, “It’s show time,” ap- peared prominently on the invitations. For many of the show business people, this will be their first trip to Cupertino, the corporate home of their new pa- trons.</P>
<P class="p16 ft7">Apple didn’t need stars before, but it needs them now. Although Apple was the first publicly traded American com- pany to be valued above $1 trillion, its most recent earnings report showed flat profits and falling revenue.</P>
<P class="p17 ft7">So the plan now is not only to sell de- vices, but to fill them with content. That has led the company into the alien terri- tory of Hollywood, where local customs can clash with Silicon Valley folkways.</P>
<P class="p13 ft7">Apple is a relatively late arrival to streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several years and are now formidable presences at the Emmys. In 2018, there were nearly 500 scripted television shows available in the United States, with Netflix spending at least $8 billion on new content. Amazon, the Walt Dis-</P>

<P class="p18 ft7">many waste companies had historically viewed recycling as a “loss leader,” of- fering the service largely to win over a municipality’s garbage business.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">That equation is starting to change. While there remains a viable market in the United States for scrap like soda bot- tles and cardboard, it is not large enough to soak up all of the plastics and paper that Americans try to recycle. The recy- cling companies say they cannot depend on selling used plastic and paper at prices that cover their processing costs, so they are asking municipalities to pay significantly more for their recycling services. Some companies are also charging customers additional “con- tamination” fees for recycled material that is mixed in with trash.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">The higher recycling fees, analysts say, will help bolster the largest compa- nies’ already booming businesses. Waste Management reported strong op- erating profits in 2018, while Republic reported increased revenue driven by its waste business.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id1_3_2">
<P class="p19 ft7">Most of the industry’s landfill in- creases were driven by economic growth: The more Americans consume, the more garbage they generate. But at least some of the higher volume were re- cyclables that could not be sold and re- purposed, analysts say.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">Some municipal leaders say they are growing wary of companies that control virtually every aspect of the waste and recycling system.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">“Are these contamination rates truly high, or is it about benefiting their cor- porate interest?” asked Mike Ryan, the mayor of Sunrise, Fla. “We can’t afford to have inspectors constantly looking over their shoulders.”</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">Unable to afford the higher costs, Sun- rise decided to burn its recycling in a fa- cility that turns waste into energy rather than send it to a landfill.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">“It’s not what most people think of as recycling, but it is better than the alter- native,” Mr. Ryan said.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2">For cities like Philadelphia, recycling had long been a point of pride. Over the</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id1_3_3">
<P class="p20 ft7">last decade, Philadelphia went from having one of the lowest recycling rates among big cities to one of the best.</P>
<P class="p21 ft7">When China was buying cardboard and plastics, recycling made money for the city some years. But last year, Phila- delphia was hit with an “outrageously high” price increase, a city spokeswom- an said in a statement.</P>
<P class="p21 ft7">The city came up with what it says will be a temporary solution. It identified the neighborhoods with the most contami- nation in its recycling bins and started sending their material to an incinerator in nearby Chester, Pa. The other neigh- borhoods still send their material to a re- cycling facility.</P>
<P class="p21 ft7">The incinerator converts the waste to energy, which can be sold back to the electrical grid, said Carlton Williams, Philadelphia’s streets commissioner. But that has done little to alleviate many residents’ environmental angst and con- cerns about increased air pollution in Chester.</P>
<P class="p22 ft2">“Residents say, ‘You are taking all our</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id1_3_4">
<P class="p18 ft7">recycling efforts, and you are burning it?’” Mr. Williams said. “They hear the word ‘burn’ and they think it is an envi- ronmental disaster.”</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">In Deltona, higher costs were not the only factor behind the decision last month to stop recycling.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">Even if the city agreed to pay the addi- tional $25,000 a month that its recycling company was charging, there was no as- surance that all the plastic containers and junk mail would be turned into something new, Mayor Heidi Herzberg said.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">“We all did recycling because it was easy, but the reality is that not much was actually being recycled,” Ms. Herzberg said.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">The troubles with recycling have am- plified calls for limiting waste at its source. Measures like banning plastic bags and straws, long pushed by envi- ronmental groups, are gaining traction more widely.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2">This month, a lobbying group for Con- necticut municipalities, citing the chaos</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id1_3_5">
<P class="p18 ft7">in local recycling programs, urged the governor to focus on restricting plastic bags, straws and packaging.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">“The sooner we accept the economic impracticality of recycling, the sooner we can make serious progress on ad- dressing the plastic pollution problem,” said Jan Dell, an engineer who leads Last Beach Cleanup. It’s an advocacy group that works with investors and nonprofits to reduce plastic pollution.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">Some large waste producers are still going through the motions of recycling, no matter how futile.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">Across Memphis, large commercial enterprises have had to stop recycling for now because of contamination prob- lems. But the airport is keeping its recy- cling bins in place to preserve “the cul- ture” of recycling among passengers and employees, a spokesman said.</P>
<P class="p19 ft2">“We want to ensure that we are able to have a seamless transition if and when <NOBR>single-stream</NOBR> recycling returns to the Memphis area,” the spokesman, Glen Thomas, said in an email.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id1_3_6">
<P class="p18 ft7">ney Company and Warner Media have increased their programming budgets to keep pace.</P>
<P class="p19 ft7">Apple has decided to put more em- phasis on its services — think Apple Mu- sic and Apple Pay — to increase reve- nues. The strategy will include an ex- pansion of Apple News, which is ex- pected to be highlighted at the showcase, and the <NOBR>star-studded</NOBR> stream- ing service. Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens, Bloomberg has re- ported, but the centerpiece will be origi- nal programming.</P>
